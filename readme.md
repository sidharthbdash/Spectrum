# Spectrum Data Science and Machine Learning Internship Project Report
## Student Grade Prediction Machine Learning using Linear regression, Decision tree and random Forest

In this internship, I have done a project based on the studentâ€™s data and their previous math-marks.
I imported different machine learning libraries like:

    1. numpy,

    2. pandas,

    3. sklearn,

    4. statsmodel.api,

    5. matplotlib,

    6. seaborn. etc..

I have added a new column by adding 'G1','G2','G3' column. After that, I pre-processed the data in a dataframe , and changed the binary attributes into 0 or 1, encoded the nominal values. Then I have used various Machine Learning models and plotted the various graphs.

In Linear Regression I used Ordinary Least Square(OLS) method for Backward Elimination of the attributes to find out which attributes affected the most.
